The site is above the tree line at a barren rocky landscape with low shrub vegetation. Between November and May the site is usually covered by snow and is accessible through the nearby ski lift and track. The National Observatory operates an Optical Telescope at a distance of 400m. On average temperature ranges from -10 in winter to 20 Celsius in summer. Instruments are housed in a stone single storey building of 40 m2. All instruments with the exception of the Meteorological mast operate inside. 4 inlets bring ambient air to the Instruments. Inlet Heads are mildly heated during winter to avoid accumulation of ice. Aerosol instruments are sampling from PM10 heads installed on the ceiling and lines are equipped with Nafion dryers to provide dry aerosol.
