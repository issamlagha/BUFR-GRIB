SCO is located on the roof of the Izaña Atmospheric Research Center's (Meteorological State Agency of Spain; AEMET)) headquarters at 52 m a.s.l. in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (the Canary Islands, Spain), by the city harbour. This station has two main objetives: 1) Provide information of background urban pollution for atmospheric research within GURME. 2) Perform complementary measurement programs to those performed at the Global GAW Izaña station The meteorology of this area is highly influenced by the North Atlantic (Azores) anticyclone, which varies in strength and position throughout the year. The low troposphere over the Canary Islands is strongly stratified. Quasi-permanent subsidence conditions in the free troposphere together with frequent trade winds flow in the lowest troposphere result in a strong and stable temperature inversion (located at 1400m a.s.l. in average) that separates a dry free troposphere from a relatively fresh and humid oceanic boundary layer. The predominance of the trade winds (NE) in the oceanic boundary layer plays a key role in the atmospheric dynamics of the islands as it favours the dispersion of pollutants from urban and industrial sites over the ocean. Consequently, the levels of atmospheric pollutants in the Tenerife Islands are often lower than those in regions with a similar urban and industrial development in continental environments.",Warm temperate - Dry and warm summer,,,,,"AERONET:Operational, GAW Regional:Operational",	2008-11-27,
