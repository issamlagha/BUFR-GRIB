Its complex orography and its long and narrow shape create a complex interaction of breezes which develop perpendicularly the two coasts with the synoptic circulation, that mainly goes west. In detail, breezes from the sea go mainly W-WSW, while breezes from the earth go mainly E-ENE. Breezes are characterized by seasonal cycles modulated by the temperature gradient between sea and land in addition to the synoptic circulation (more prevalent in determining local circulation in late fall and winter). In particular, while during the summer, there are strong breezes from the sea during the day, in winter there are, at night, intense breezes coming from the land. It was also demonstrated how the breeze system dominated atmospheric circulation in Lamezia Terme and it has an important role in defining local climates. The area presents polluting emissions coming from transportation, (airport, cruises from/to Gioia Tauro, local and highway traffic), houses and agriculture in addition to the deposits of a natural particulate like Saharan sand, and volcanic particulate coming from the two active volcanoes in the Mediterranean (Stromboli and Etna situated 80 km west and around 200 km south-east of the measurement site respectively). Studying atmospheric circulation becomes particularly relevant in order to characterize variability of atmospheric composition, for researches regarding renewable (solar and wind) energy and for the coast characterization to prevent fires and erosion.",Warm Temperate - Fully humid - Hot summer,,,,,GAW Regional:Operational,	2018-03-23,Claudia Roberta Calidonna
