Monitoring site is surrounded mostly by short grass (above 1600 m) and partly by coniferous forest (below 1600 m). The surrounding mountain peaks are rocky (limestone). The site is situated about 30 km north of Ljubljana (capital of Slovenia), on the ridge of the south-eastern Alps (Karavanke mountain ridge with peaks of 1500-2500 m a.s.l.). The monitoring site is above the cold surface layer of air which forms in the Ljubljana basin. Sometimes, not very often, the inversion layer at the height of 2-3 km a.s.l.
