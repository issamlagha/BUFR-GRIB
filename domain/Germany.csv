It is located in southern Germany, about 90 km southwest of Munich, at the Austrian border near the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (720 m a.s.l.). A cable car leads directly from Garmisch to Zugspitze. Monitoring of air pollution up to 2001 was carried out from an aluminium sheltered cabin on the view point terrace (47°25' N 10°59' E; 2962 m a.s.l.) with the air inlet system and meteorological sensors mounted on the flat roof of the shelter. Activities were re-located in 2000 to the new Environmental Research Station ""Schneefernerhaus"" at 2650 m a.s.l. on the southern slope of Zugspitze. Together with the Meteorological Observatory Hohenpeissenberg (40 km north), this platform establishes the Global Station Zugspitze/Hohenpeissenberg. The monitoring program is operated jointly by the Federal Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) and the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD).",Polar - Tundra,,,,,"GAW Global:Operational, NDACC:Operational, NOAA-GML:Operational, TCCON:Operational",	2024-06-19,Marc Kinkeldey
